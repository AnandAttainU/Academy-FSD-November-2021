website should have these routes:
1. / - home/root route
2. /login
3. /profile

if user goes to home page(/) then if unauthenticated, we should redirect to login page,
else if authenticated - then show a page with button called profile

on click of profile button:
 go to /profile route and render the profile details:
    like - name, last name, image, etc.
